# Grocery Basket

This _Basket_ app allows you to add items and associated quantities to a shopping list. Once you put an item in your basket, you can check off that item from the list. Doing that will clear the item from the list.

There is also a recommendations list. Things that are usually purchased, but aren't on your shopping list, appear there. You can add whichever items you like from there to your shopping list, or delete it.

## Installation

Clone the app.

```
git clone git@github.com:SarahYiskah/basket.git
cd basket
```

Run

```
npm install && npm start
```
That's it! The app should be up and running on http://localhost:3000/.
